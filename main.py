    Company Description: {description}
    
    You are a professional proposal writer. Your task is to generate a well-structured and visually appealing RFP (Request for Proposal) response tailored to the companyâ€™s description and tone.

    The response should be organized into the following sections:
    - Executive Summary
    - Project Approach
    - Pricing and Deliverables
    - Conclusion

    Each section will have its own page so remember to make the content relevant and visually appealing by adding in bullet points, tables, and headings.


    ### **Response Format:**
    - Use **clear section headings** (e.g., Executive Summary, Technical Approach, Past Performance).
    - Use **bullet points** for key details when appropriate.
    - Keep **paragraphs concise** for readability.
    - Add space between sections for **visual appeal**.
    - Maintain **professional and formal tone**.

    ### **RFP Content to Respond To:**
    {extracted_text}

    Ensure the response is **well-organized** and adheres to best practices for professional proposals.
